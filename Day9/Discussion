💡 Day 9 of 90 Days of Reinforcement Learning

Topic: Policies in Reinforcement Learning

A policy is like the brain of an RL agent — it defines how the agent chooses actions based on the current state.

🔹 Types of Policies:
1️⃣ Deterministic Policy

Always chooses the same action for a given state.

Example: If it's raining, always carry an umbrella. ☔

2️⃣ Stochastic Policy

Chooses actions probabilistically for a given state.

Example: If it's cloudy, there's a 70% chance you take an umbrella and 30% chance you don’t. 🌥️

💡 Key Insight:
A well-optimized policy leads to optimal decision-making.
Most RL algorithms, like Policy Gradient or Actor-Critic, focus on finding the best policy to maximize rewards.

🔑 Takeaway:
The policy is the agent’s strategy — it’s how the agent behaves and improves over time through learning.
