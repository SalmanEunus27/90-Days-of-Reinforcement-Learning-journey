💡 **Day 3 of 90 Days of Reinforcement Learning**

Today’s topic: **How is Reinforcement Learning different from Supervised and Unsupervised Learning?**

🔹 **Supervised Learning**

* Learns from labeled data (input → correct output).
* Example: Predicting house prices from historical data.

🔹 **Unsupervised Learning**

* Finds hidden patterns or groupings in data without labels.
* Example: Customer segmentation in marketing.

🔹 **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**

* No labeled data. Instead, the agent learns by *interacting with the environment*.
* It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
* Example: A robot learning to walk or an AI playing chess.

👉 **Key Difference:**

* Supervised: *“Here’s the answer, learn the mapping.”*
* Unsupervised: *“Here’s the data, find structure.”*
* RL: *“Try things, get feedback, and improve.”*

🔑 **Takeaway:**
Reinforcement Learning is more about **experience-driven learning** compared to supervised and unsupervised learning. It’s closer to how humans and animals learn in the real world.
