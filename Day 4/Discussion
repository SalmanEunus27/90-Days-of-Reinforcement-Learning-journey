Todayâ€™s focus: The Core Components of Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning revolves around a simple but powerful setup:

ðŸ”¹ Agent â†’ The learner/decision maker (e.g., robot, game bot).
ðŸ”¹ Environment â†’ The world the agent interacts with (game, simulation, real world).
ðŸ”¹ State (s) â†’ The current situation the agent is in.
ðŸ”¹ Action (a) â†’ The choice the agent makes.
ðŸ”¹ Reward (r) â†’ The feedback signal (positive or negative).

ðŸ‘‰ The cycle:

Agent observes state (s)

Agent takes an action (a)

Environment gives new state (sâ€²) + reward (r)

Agent updates its strategy (policy) to improve future actions

ðŸ”‘ Takeaway:
Reinforcement Learning is basically an interaction loop where an agent continuously learns how to make better decisions through feedback.

This framework is universal â€“ whether itâ€™s an AI playing chess, a robot learning to walk, or a system optimizing ad placement.
