🚀 **Day 13: Q-Learning – The Classic RL Algorithm**

Today, I explored **Q-Learning**, one of the most popular and foundational algorithms in reinforcement learning.

Q-Learning is all about **learning the value of taking a specific action in a specific state** — also known as the **Q-value**.
The goal? Learn an **optimal policy** that maximizes total future rewards.

### 🔹 **Q-Learning Update Rule:**

[
Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \alpha \big[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)\big]
]

Where:

* **α (alpha):** Learning rate
* **γ (gamma):** Discount factor
* **r:** Immediate reward
* **s':** Next state
* **max Q:** Chooses the best possible future action

💡 **Why it’s powerful:**

* **Model-free:** No need to know environment dynamics.
* Works with both discrete and continuous problems.
* Foundation for advanced techniques like **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**.

🎯 **Real-world analogy:**
Imagine playing a video game where you **trial-and-error every move**, remember the outcomes, and gradually figure out the *best moves* to win.
That’s Q-Learning in action! 🕹️
