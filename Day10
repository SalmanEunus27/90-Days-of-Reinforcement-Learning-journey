🚀 **Day 10 of 90 Days of Reinforcement Learning**

**Topic:** *The Bellman Equation — The Backbone of RL*

The **Bellman Equation** is one of the most fundamental concepts in RL.
It provides a **recursive relationship** to calculate the value of a state or action by breaking it into **current reward + future expected rewards**.

🔹 **For State Value Function:**
[
V(s) = R(s) + \gamma \sum P(s'|s, a) V(s')
]

* **V(s):** Value of current state
* **R(s):** Immediate reward at state *s*
* **γ (gamma):** Discount factor for future rewards
* **P(s'|s, a):** Probability of moving to next state *s'*

---

💡 **Why it matters:**

* Helps an agent **plan ahead**, not just react.
* Forms the foundation for **Dynamic Programming**, **Q-Learning**, and **Deep RL** algorithms.
* Think of it like budgeting:

  > *Immediate money (reward now) + expected future income (discounted future rewards).*

🔑 **Takeaway:**
If Reinforcement Learning had a "law of motion," the **Bellman Equation** would be it!
