Hereâ€™s a ready-to-use **Day 1 LinkedIn post** for your *90 Days of Reinforcement Learning* journey ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ’¡ **Day 1 of 90 Days of Reinforcement Learning ðŸš€**

Today, Iâ€™m officially starting my **90-day challenge to learn Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and share my journey here on LinkedIn.

ðŸ”¹ Why RL?
Reinforcement Learning is the science of decision-making â€“ how an agent learns to interact with an environment, take actions, and maximize rewards. It powers breakthroughs in:

* ðŸ¤– Robotics
* ðŸŽ® Game AI (e.g., AlphaGo, Atari)
* ðŸ’Š Healthcare optimization
* ðŸ“ˆ Finance & trading
* ðŸ§  Large Language Models (RLHF in ChatGPT!)

ðŸ”¹ My Goal:

* Build strong foundations in RL
* Implement classical & deep RL algorithms
* Work on projects (CartPole, LunarLander, BipedalWalker, etc.)
* Explore advanced topics like Multi-Agent RL, Model-Based RL, and RLHF
* Share insights daily for 90 days

ðŸ”¹ Why Share Publicly?
To stay accountable, learn in public, and spark discussions with others who are curious about RL.

ðŸ‘‰ Todayâ€™s takeaway:
Reinforcement Learning is about **learning by interacting with the world**. Just like humans learn to ride a bike by trial and error, RL agents learn through feedback (rewards & penalties).
