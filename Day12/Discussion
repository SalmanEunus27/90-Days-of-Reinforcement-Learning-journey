🎲 **Day 12: Monte Carlo Methods in Reinforcement Learning**

Imagine you're learning to play chess.
You play a full game, win or lose, **then** sit down to analyze what went right or wrong.
That’s exactly how **Monte Carlo (MC) methods** work in RL!

In Monte Carlo learning, the agent:
1️⃣ **Plays through a complete episode** (start → finish).
2️⃣ **Collects total rewards** it earned along the way.
3️⃣ **Updates its strategy** by averaging these total returns for each visited state.

🔹 **Why it’s unique:**
Unlike **Temporal Difference (TD)**, which updates values **step-by-step**,
MC waits until the **end of the episode** before making changes.
It’s simple and intuitive — but can feel slow when episodes are long. ⏳

---

💡 **Takeaway:**
Monte Carlo is perfect when you want to learn **directly from experience** without needing to know how the environment works.

Think of it as *learning from full stories*, while TD focuses on *learning from each chapter*. 📚
