🚀 Day 5 of 90 Days of Reinforcement Learning

Today’s topic: Types of Reinforcement Learning

There are two main categories:

🔹 Positive Reinforcement

Adding a reward after a desired action.

Example: Giving points to an agent for reaching the goal.

Effect: Encourages repetition of good behavior.

🔹 Negative Reinforcement

Removing an unpleasant outcome when the right action is taken.

Example: A robot avoids collision → penalty is removed.

Effect: Strengthens the action that prevents negative results.

⚖️ Both play important roles in how agents learn to adapt and optimize behavior in different environments.

🔑 Takeaway:
Reinforcement Learning doesn’t just mean “rewards” — it also includes learning by avoiding penalties.
