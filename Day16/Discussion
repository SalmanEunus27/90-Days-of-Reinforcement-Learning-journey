**Day 16 — Double DQN (DDQN): Tackling Overestimation in Q-Learning**

Today, let’s explore how **Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN)** solve one of the biggest issues in DQN — **overestimation bias**.

🔹 **Problem with DQN:**
In standard DQN, the same network is used to both **select** and **evaluate** actions, which can lead to overly optimistic value estimates.

🔹 **DDQN Solution:**
DDQN decouples these two steps:

1. **Action Selection:** Choose the best action using the main Q-network.
2. **Action Evaluation:** Use the target network to estimate the Q-value of that action.

This reduces overestimation and stabilizes training, especially in complex environments.

🧠 **Equation:**
[
y = r + \gamma Q_{\text{target}}(s', \arg\max_a Q_{\text{main}}(s', a))
]

🎯 **Key Benefits:**

* Reduces bias in Q-value estimates
* Improves stability and performance
* Used in advanced RL algorithms like **Rainbow DQN**

💬 *DDQN shows how small architectural tweaks can bring big improvements to learning performance.*
