💡 Day 2 of 90 Days of Reinforcement Learning

Yesterday I introduced my journey. Today, let’s answer a simple but important question:

👉 What is Reinforcement Learning (RL)?

Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns by interacting with an environment.

The agent takes actions

The environment responds with a new state and a reward

Over time, the agent learns a strategy (policy) that maximizes long-term reward

🔹 A Simple Analogy:
Think of a dog learning a trick 🐕

If it sits when asked → gets a treat 🍪 (positive reward)

If it ignores → no treat (zero or negative reward)
Over repeated trials, the dog learns the behavior that maximizes treats.

🔹 Why it’s powerful:
RL mimics how humans and animals learn from experience, which makes it a natural fit for real-world problems like:

Robots learning to walk

AI agents mastering games like Chess & Go

Systems optimizing logistics or treatment schedules

👉 Takeaway: RL is not about being told the “right answer.” It’s about discovering it through trial and error.
