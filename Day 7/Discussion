Topic: The Markov Decision Process (MDP)

The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is the mathematical foundation of Reinforcement Learning. It provides a formal way to model environments where decisions are made in a step-by-step manner.

🔹 Key Components of MDP

States (S): Possible situations the agent can be in.

Actions (A): Choices available to the agent.

Transition Function (P): Probability of moving from one state to another after taking an action.

Reward Function (R): Feedback received for each action.

Discount Factor (γ): Determines the importance of future rewards.

💡 Markov Property:
The future state depends only on the current state and action, not on past states.

Think of it like “Memoryless decision-making” — just like predicting tomorrow’s weather based only on today’s conditions.

🔑 Takeaway:
Understanding MDPs is crucial because every RL problem can be modeled as an MDP. It’s the starting point for algorithms like Dynamic Programming, Q-Learning, and Policy Gradients.
