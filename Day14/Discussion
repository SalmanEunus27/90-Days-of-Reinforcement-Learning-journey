🔥 **Day 14: SARSA – On-Policy Learning in RL**

Today, I explored **SARSA**, another fundamental RL algorithm closely related to Q-Learning.

While **Q-Learning** is **off-policy** (learning from the *best possible future action*),
**SARSA** is **on-policy**, meaning it updates its values based on the **actual action** taken by the agent.

### 🔹 **SARSA Update Rule:**

[
Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + \alpha \big[r + \gamma Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)\big]
]

Where:

* **α (alpha):** Learning rate
* **γ (gamma):** Discount factor
* **r:** Reward received
* **s', a':** Next state and action actually taken

---

💡 **Key Difference:**

* **Q-Learning (Off-policy):** Learns using the *optimal next action*.
* **SARSA (On-policy):** Learns using the *actual next action* chosen by the current policy.

---

🎮 **Analogy:**
Imagine teaching someone to play a game:

* **Q-Learning:** "Always assume you’ll play perfectly next turn."
* **SARSA:** "Learn from the move you *actually made*, mistakes and all."

---

SARSA is ideal when **safety matters** because it learns from real behavior, not just theoretical optimal moves.
