🔎 Today’s topic: Exploration vs Exploitation Dilemma

In RL, an agent faces a constant trade-off:

⚡ Exploration → Trying new actions to discover better strategies.

Example: A self-driving car tests a new route it has never taken.

⚡ Exploitation → Using known actions that give the highest reward.

Example: The same car always takes the fastest known route.

💡 The key challenge:
If an agent only exploits, it might miss better options.
If it only explores, it wastes time without improving performance.

🔑 Takeaway:
Balancing exploration and exploitation is the heart of reinforcement learning — often handled by strategies like ε-greedy, softmax, or UCB.
