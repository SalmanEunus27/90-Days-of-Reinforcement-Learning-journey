Topic: Understanding Value Functions in RL

In Reinforcement Learning, an agent needs a way to evaluate how good it is to be in a particular state or take a particular action.
This is where Value Functions come in.

🔹 Two main types of value functions:

1️⃣ State Value Function (V(s))

Measures how good it is to be in state s.

Represents the expected total reward from that state onward.

Example: A chess position that sets you up for victory.

2️⃣ Action Value Function (Q(s, a))

Measures how good it is to take action when in a state s.

Example: Deciding whether to move a knight or a bishop in chess.

💡 Why it matters:
Value functions help agents decide “Which move is best?” by predicting future rewards.
Almost every RL algorithm — like Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) — relies on these functions.

🔑 Takeaway:
If rewards are the “currency” of RL, value functions are the bank account that helps agents plan for the future.
