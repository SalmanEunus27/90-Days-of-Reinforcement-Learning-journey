**📘 Day 15: Deep Q-Networks (DQN) — Bridging Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning**

Today marks a major step in your RL journey — we combine neural networks with Q-Learning to create **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, a core idea behind modern AI agents like those used in **Atari games and autonomous systems**.

### 🧠 What is DQN?

DQN replaces the traditional **Q-table** with a **neural network** that approximates the Q-value function:

[
Q(s,a; \theta) \approx Q^*(s,a)
]

where ( \theta ) are the network parameters.

### ⚙️ Key Concepts

* **Experience Replay** 🌀
  Stores past experiences ((s, a, r, s')) in a buffer.
  Samples random mini-batches during training to **break correlation** and **stabilize learning**.

* **Target Network** 🎯
  A copy of the Q-network used to compute target values.
  Updated slowly to reduce oscillations and divergence.

### 🧩 DQN Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize Q-network and target network.
2. For each episode:

   * Choose an action using ε-greedy policy.
   * Perform action → observe reward & next state.
   * Store transition in replay memory.
   * Sample random batch from memory.
   * Compute target:
     [
     y = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\text{target}}(s', a')
     ]
   * Update Q-network weights via gradient descent.
3. Periodically update the target network.
